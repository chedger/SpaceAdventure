            In Space Adventure, you take control of a spaceship, navigating through a cosmic battlefield filled with gems and dangerous asteroids. Your main objective is to collect the sparkling gems while avoiding collisions with perilous asteroids. Use the arrow keys to maneuver your spaceship around. As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more challenging with an increase in asteroids. Collect all the gems in a level to advance, but be warned: one hit from an asteroid, and its game over! Restart the game to try again and beat your high score. Happy space exploring!
